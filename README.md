# Shopping_App

A clone of Shopping like App UI, no backend has been used.
I have learnt a lot from this project, specifically UI-widget responsiveness.
 - Widget build and rebuild
 - Frame rate control and smoothness improvement
 - Use of class, enum, Map, List in data-structure
 - And many other interactive Flutter Stuffs.

## About Flutter

Flutter is really a very very good framework for Mobile Development.
One of it's uniqueness is that Flutter do everything by own from pixel painting to widget animation rendering.
